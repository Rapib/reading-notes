# 04 - Structure web pages with HTML

## Wireframeing

The basic website structure without  color. Users should be able to navigate the website easily if done correctly,  
It is recommended to use pencil to draw it out or some other apps to design before building the actual website. Coding should be the last step in the process.

Some wireframe software:
- UXPin
- InVision
- Wireframe.cc

Some ideas to get started:

- look at other website for reference
- imagine the user flows
- use Proto.io, Adobe XD, Framer, Sketch, Figma to build prototypes
- import them into InVision

*Be simple, clear,and have faith.*

## html

HTML = HyperText **Markup** Language

html is the structure and CSS is the style of a website.

> `<p>TEXT</p>`


the whole thing is a emelemt.
`<p>` is the opening tag & `</p>` is the closing tag

### elements can also have attributes

> `<img src="image link" alt="alt text"`>

src and alt are both attributes

some html elements:


> `<!DOCTYPE html>`

not releally necessary todays

> `<head></head>`

won't be visible to readers, but search engine results will take it; CSS tstyle; character set declaration

> `<title></title>`

the title of the page

> `<a href="link">Name to website</a>`

link to website

***semantic elements like `<h1>` will be treated more as important keywords by search engine*** 

some other samples:

- `<footer>`

- `<header>`

- `<main>`

- `<mark>`

- `<nav>`
